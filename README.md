# Educational Technology Plan

The following is an outline of the technology implementation plan for a high school computer science course.

## Context

### Course

AP Computer Science Principles    
An introductory Computer Science course designed to introduce students to  
fundamental computing concepts and practices.    
Grades 10-12

### Situation

This course will be offered at a public high school serving a suburban community
in the Northern Bay Area of California. Total enrollment is approimately 1600,
and a significant portion of the student body, about 10%, are English Language Learners.
The school's [Ethnic Diversity Index](ed-data.org/article/Ethnic-Diversity-Index) is 44.
The ethnic breakdown of the student population is 47.7%  Hispanic or Latino, 40.2% White,
6% two races or more, 3.1% Asian, 1.3% African American, 0.7% Filopino, 0.4% American Indian 
or Alaska Native, 0.2% Pacific Islander, and 0.3% not reported. Approximately 49% of students 
qualify for free and reduced-price meals. 

Enrollment in CS courses tends to be relatively low, with one section of AP Computer Science 
offered each year. Typical enrollment for this course is anywhere from 20-30 students. There is a 
great deal of diversity among students in regard to prior coding experience. The surrounding community
is home to a significant number of tech-sector workers, many of whom have children who have some exposure
to programming prior to enrolling in the course. However, many AP Computer Science students are first time 
programmers with no prior knowledge.

The school is part of a one-to-one district, meaning that each student has a personal computing device
that they use during the school day. Some student's families purchase laptops, but the majority use
school-issued Chromebooks. Therefore, all instructional materials and tools must be accessible
across multiple operating systems, and web-based tools are integral to ensuring an equitable 
learning experience for all students.

On a personal note, this will be my 15th year teaching at this school. I hold a Single Subject Credential
in Secondary Mathematics, but I taught myself to code in Java and Python in order to begin teaching CS courses in 2015. 
This will be my 10th year teaching computer science. Prior to the 25-26 school year, I taught AP Computer Science A 
and Computer Science Intro. This year I will be teaching AP Computer Science Principles for the first time, with
the hopes of alternating between both AP CS courses in the future. Teaching CS "out of field" has
been equal parts a daunting and rewarding experience. While I have a solid foundation of content knowledge in the 
courses I've already taught, the AP CSP curriculum incorporates some areas I'm not as familiar with. In addition,
the AP CSP Exam involves some writing components that are very different from the types of assessments I've prepared
students for in the past. While I look forward to learning new ideas alongside my students, I will be decidedly outside
my comfort zone as I navigate the first year of this new course.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

* A typical day in class will begin with warm-up excercises for students displayed
  on the TV or projector. These may involve unplugged activities for students, such as
  journal prompts, or students may be asked to complete a digital activity, such as a
  game or puzzle, on their personal device. These warm-ups will typically be followed
  by small group or whole class debriefs to capture important themes or highlight
  interesting student ideas.
* Most days, an opportunity will be provided for students to ask questions about
  previously assigned homework exercises. If there are problems students find particularly
  challenging, the instructor will share solutions and discuss common errors or misconceptions.
  During this time the instructor will use the digital displays to screen-share while
  providing a walkthrough of solutions and fielding student questions.
* Lessons: Code.org, CodeHS, and teacher-created presentations/demos
  The main portion of each lesson may take one of several formats: <ins>direct instruction</ins>, <ins>small group
  activities</ins>, <ins>independent practice</ins>, and <ins>long-form projects</ins>.

    *<ins>Direct instruction</ins> lessons will involve the instructor demonstrating skills or concepts through guided practice.
  This may take the form of a follow-along coding exercise paired with note-taking. The TV display will mirror the
  instructor's device, allowing students to watch as the instructor writes code. A projector will display notes or
  lecture slides to accompany the coding demo.

    *<ins>Small group activities</ins> typically consist of a guided lesson on Code.org. Students utilize online widgets, printed graphic
  organizers, and manipulatives to "learn by doing" as they explore the central lesson concept. This type of lesson
  shifts between instructor-led, individual, and small group activities and discussions. Students may
  draw diagrams to illustrate vocabulary terms, or create physical models to illustrate computing concepts.

    *<ins>Independent practice will include:
      * Student activities: Code.org widgets, CodeHS coding exercises, journaling & interactive notebook
      * DeltaMath independent practice exercises
      * CodeHS Sandbox for larger programming projects
      * AP Classroom used for exam preparation
      * Google Doc creating & editing
      * Submit all assignments to Google Classroom (or link assignments from Code.org, CodeHS)
      
    *<ins>Long-form projects</ins> will entail written reflections or coding projects. 

* Assessments projects & test/quiz (test quiz no device allowed to deter cheating)
* All lesson presentations, assignments & important content will be posted by instructor on Google Classroom (ensure compliance with IEPs/504)
* Screencastify may be used to record portions of lessons, such as programming demos. These will also be posted to Google Classroom.


### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
