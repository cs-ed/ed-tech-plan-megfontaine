# Educational Technology Plan

The following is an outline of the technology implementation plan for a high school computer science course.

## Context

### Course

AP Computer Science Principles    
An introductory Computer Science course designed to introduce students to the 
fundamental concepts and ideas central to the field.    
Grades 10-12

### Situation

This course will be offered at a public high school serving a suburban community
in the Northern Bay Area of California. Total enrollment is approimately 1600,
and a significant portion of the student body, about 10%, are English Language Learners.
The school's [Ethnic Diversity Index](ed-data.org/article/Ethnic-Diversity-Index) is 44.
The ethnic breakdown of the student population is 47.7%  Hispanic or Latino, 40.2% White,
6% two races or more, 3.1% Asian, 1.3% African American, 0.7% Filopino, 0.4% American Indian 
or Alaska Native, 0.2% Pacific Islander, and 0.3% not reported. Approximately 49% of students 
qualify for free and reduced-price meals. 

Enrollment in CS courses tends to be relatively low, with one section of AP Computer Science 
offered each year. Typical enrollment for this course is anywhere from 20-30 students. There is a 
great deal of diversity among students in regard to prior coding experience. The surrounding community
is home to a significant number of tech-sector workers, many of whom have children who have some exposure
to programming prior to enrolling in the course. At the same time, many of the students enrolled in 
AP Computer Science are first time programmers with no prior knowledge.

The school is part of a one-to-one district, meaning that each student has a personal computing device
that they use during the school day. Some student's families purchase laptops, but the majority use
school-issued Chromebooks. Therefore, all instructional materials and tools must be accessible
across multiple operating systems, and web-based tools are integral to ensuring an equitable 
learning experience for all students.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
